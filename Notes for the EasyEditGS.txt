Notes for the EasyEditGS
=========================

Once the theme is installed correctly, open the file 'header.inc.php'.
Next change the username (located in line 62) to your own user name.  

This will ensure only you can edit the home page.

When you next login and visit the home page, you will be able to update 
specific elements highlighted by a blue background.

Simply click the relevant pencil icon to activate the edit function.
Once clicked, you will see a red dotted border appear around the element.
This provides an indicator that you can now proceed with editing your text.

To save the edit, simply reclick the pencil icon.

The results of your edit will automatically be saved to the components xml file.
