# simpleOfficeTheme

Install theme as normal and then make sure the home page uses the home template. 
To activate the home page editing mode, open the header include file and simply ensure you change the value if($userOnline === "debbie9754").

Change debbie9754 to your own login account name.

Once you login, go to the home page (front end view) and you will see highlighted blue areas with a pencil icon in each editable area. 

Click the pencil of the area you wish to edit and then change your text. Once you're done, re click the pencil to save the change for that element.

**PLEASE NOTE: THIS IS STILL IN TESTING PHASE, USE AT YOUR OWN RISK. 

This is a test theme to see how contenteditable works within GS

Any feedback is more than welcome
